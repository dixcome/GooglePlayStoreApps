    " Google Play Store - is a distribution service established by Google. It allows side companies to spread and offer a variety    of applications compatible with Android operation system. Initially, Google announced the opening of Andorid Market online-shop on the 22nd of October in 2008. It provided a combination of music, book, video and games services. Talking exactly about applications, the developers pay a 25$ fee for a publication ability. \n",
    " \n",
    " As a result of rebrending that took place in March, 2012, Android Market portal became a currently known Google Play Store. According to the monetization policy, the application developers basing on this platform recieve 70 percent of profit, while other 30 percent go for billing maintenance. From that time the folowing sequence of major updates was released: 2014 - paying with Paypal function; March, 2016 - free 10 minute game trial in browser function; April, 2016 - advertising opportunities. \n",
    " \n",
    " As seen from the above, Google Play Market is a loyal and dynamic platform for app developers, thus there could be found more than 2,9 million applications on the free or paid base. The Google Play inludes 34 app categories such as Business, Health, Education, Arcade and etc. Overall, users from 145 country have an opportunity to install and users from 150 countries could spread applications.

    "Google Play Store phenomenon provides quite a huge base for a variety of analysises from different aspects. It would be beneficial to analyze the efficiency of particular applications grouped by size, rating, genre etc. for future app publications.

The dataset is relatively new, dated by 2018.\n",
